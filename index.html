Each tool or service that has a dedicated guide lives on its own subdomain.</p><p>Examples:</p><ul><li>marblism.workflowreference.com</li><li>toolname.workflowreference.com</li></ul><p>Each subdomain hub is independent and focused on a single tool.</p><p>A typical hub includes:</p><ul><li>A plain-language explanation of what the tool does</li><li>Clear use cases and workflow examples</li><li>Embedded walkthroughs or demonstrations (when available)</li><li>A direct link to the tool’s official site</li></ul><p>Content is designed to be informative and practical, not persuasive.</p><hr><h2 id="why-this-approach">Why This Approach</h2><h3 id="task-first-not-brand-first">Task-First, Not Brand-First</h3><p>Tools are best understood by the problems they solve. Each guide is structured around common jobs-to-be-done rather than feature lists or branding language.</p><h3 id="neutral-and-evergreen">Neutral and Evergreen</h3><p>Pages are written to remain useful over time. There is no focus on trends, algorithms, or frequent publishing.</p><h3 id="clear-and-accessible">Clear and Accessible</h3><p>Content is organized for scanning, comparison, and reference. The emphasis is clarity over personality.</p><h3 id="modular-by-design">Modular by Design</h3><p>Each tool has its own space. This keeps scope tight and allows multiple references to coexist without overlap.</p><hr><h2 id="affiliate-transparency">Affiliate Transparency</h2><p>Some tool hubs may include affiliate links.</p><p>If you click a link to a tool and later make a purchase, a commission may be earned at no additional cost to you. This helps support hosting and maintenance.</p><p>Affiliate links are never required for the workflow content itself to be useful.</p><hr><h2 id="how-to-use-this-site">How to Use This Site</h2><ul><li>Visit a tool’s subdomain to understand how it fits specific workflows</li><li>Read hubs independently rather than as a ranked list</li><li>Use the content as a reference point when evaluating tools for your own work</li></ul><p>This site is intended to support decision-making, not push outcomes.</p><hr><h2 id="example-subdomains">Example Subdomains</h2><ul><li><strong>Marblism</strong><br>marblism.workflowreference.com<br>Practical workflow reference for AI-assisted task automation</li></ul><p>Additional tool hubs may be added over time as reference material is completed.</p><hr><h2 id="content-standards">Content Standards</h2><p>Every guide published under this domain follows these principles:</p><ul><li>One tool per hub</li><li>Narrow, clearly defined use cases</li><li>Neutral language without exaggerated claims</li><li>Pricing references based only on publicly available information</li><li>Descriptions limited to documented or demonstrable capabilities</li></ul><hr><h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p><strong>Is this a blog?</strong><br>No. This is a reference catalog. Content is structured documentation, not ongoing commentary.</p><p><strong>Are these reviews or rankings?</strong><br>No. These are workflow and use-case references. Tools are not ranked or scored.</p><p><strong>Why use subdomains instead of one large site?</strong><br>Subdomains keep each tool isolated and focused, reducing scope creep and maintaining clarity.</p><hr><h2 id="contact">Contact</h2><p>If you have a suggestion for a tool workflow that should be documented, or notice an error in a guide, contact information is provided in the site footer.</p><hr><p>WorkflowReference.com is maintained as an evergreen reference for task-oriented tool workflows.<br>The emphasis is accuracy, clarity, and repeatability — not promotion.</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://workflowreference.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://workflowreference.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
